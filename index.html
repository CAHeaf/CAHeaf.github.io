        <h3><u>A developer in development:</u></h3>
        <p>For a long time, I've had the desire to create things. This desire
        hasn't really been realized until recently. I don't really know what I'm doing just yet with code but I've been learning. :)
        One day I hope to be not too bad, sooner rather than later. Anyway, feel free to take a look around,
        make sure to let me know any feedback you have, ways to reach me will be listed on the <a href="./aboutme.html">About Me</a>
        page. If you need to reach me, twitter is probably the easiest way.</p>
